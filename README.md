# 🏃‍♂️ Human Pose Estimation (HPE)  

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a powerful computer vision technique that detects and analyzes human body keypoints (joints) from images or videos. It identifies body parts such as the **head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles**, enabling machines to understand human movements and postures.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Detects and tracks human body keypoints  
✅ Supports image and video processing  
✅ Adjustable confidence threshold for accuracy  
✅ Powered by **OpenCV** and **OpenPose**  

## 📌 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:  

- **OpenCV**  
- **OpenPose**  

## 🚀 How to Use  

Run the following commands to perform pose estimation:  

### 🔹 Basic Pose Estimation  
```bash
python openpose.py
```  

### 🔹 Pose Estimation on an Image  
```bash
python openpose.py --input image.jpg
```  

### 🔹 Pose Estimation with Confidence Threshold  
```bash
python openpose.py --input image.jpg --thr 0.5
```
